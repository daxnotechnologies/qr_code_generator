MobileApp:
========
Where is the backend deployed when we attempt to test Create or scan Menu from the mobile app?
How to validate the backend/DB?

* I see the login ("Mukhtar Abbas")is hardcoded in the mobile App. Not sure where the data is stored.
* Basic scan from the mobile app is not working {Only camera is ON, no scan is made]
* "Scan from Gallery" link is not working.
* No hyperlinks from the "App Drawer" are clickable.
* Create Menu from the App is not working.
* "Add menu" is not clearing the previous entries after add item is clicked.
* Total value displayed during Create Menu is hardcoded to $38.
* Create Menu has no action if the background and header image is not uploaded. Background and header must be optional and without this also "create menu" should be allowed.
* No option to view the menu created from the mobile app. (Listing menu).
* Check box under "category" is not toggled (always checked) and it's hardcoded during Menu create.
* Settings icon hyperlinks are not working.
* Folder Creation is not working.
* No data sync between webapp and mobile app.
* In the phone number field "text is also allowed"
=====
* Add survey button is missing.
* "No Survey found"
* unable to submit survey since Submit Survey button has no action.
